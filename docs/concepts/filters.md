# Filters

## Filtering Messages

When you are consuming from a topic that collects data from multiple publishers and you are concerned with only a particular subset of that data, in that case, you donâ€™t need to consume all of it from the topic.

Instead, use this Filter feature provided in Firehose which allows you to apply any filters on the fields present in the key or message of the event data set and helps you narrow it down to your use case-specific data.

However, understand that you are ignoring some data/messages and if that ignored value is important for your sink, you might lose/skip data that is essential. So it is best to verify that your filter condition is not skipping essential data, for example, payment transactions.

Firehose uses the Apache Commons JEXL library for parsing the filter expressions. Refer to the [Using Filters](../guides/filters.md) section for details on how to configure filters.

## JEXL \(Java EXpressions Language\)

JEXL is an Apache Commons library intended to facilitate the implementation of dynamic and scripting features in applications and frameworks written in Java. Its goal is to expose scripting features usable by technical operatives or consultants working with enterprise platforms.

The API and the expression language exploit Java-beans naming patterns through introspection to expose property getters and setters. It also considers public class fields as properties and allows to invoke any accessible method.

To evaluate expressions using JEXL, you need three things:

* An [engine](https://commons.apache.org/jexl/apidocs/org/apache/commons/jexl3/JexlEngine.html) to create expressions,
* A [context](https://commons.apache.org/jexl/apidocs/org/apache/commons/jexl3/JexlContext.html) containing any variables, and
* An [expression](https://commons.apache.org/jexl/apidocs/org/apache/commons/jexl3/Expression.html)

## How Filters Work

The filtering occurs in the following steps - 

* Firehose Consumer creates a Filter object and initializes it with the values of -`FILTER_JEXL_DATA_SOURCE` i.e. key/message,`FILTER_JEXL_EXPRESSION` and `FILTER_JEXL_SCHEMA_PROTO_CLASS`as configured in the environment variables. 



* `MessageFilter` iterates over the input List of events. For each event, the Protobuf Class as specified by the environment variable `FILTER_JEXL_SCHEMA_PROTO_CLASS` , converts the key/message of the event from raw byte array to a POJO \(Plain Old Java Object\), which contains getters for accessing various fields of the event data.



* A`JEXLContext` is created to link the key/message proto reference in the JEXL expression with the POJO object generated earlier.  JEXL engine converts `FILTER_JEXL_EXPRESSION`  string into `JEXLExpression` object and replaces all occurrences of references in the string by the generated POJO object.  `JEXLException` is thrown if the filter expression is invalid. 



* The `JEXLExpression` is then evaluated for each of these parsed events. The messages for which the `JEXLExpression` evaluates to `true`, are added to the output List of messages and returned by the Filter. The rest of the messages are discarded by the Filter

## Why Use Filters 

Filters enable you to consume only a smaller subset of incoming messages fulfilling a particular set of criteria while discarding other messages. This is helpful in cases like for e.g.- processing the status of drivers riding a bike, obtaining data of drivers within a particular city, etc.

Additionally, Filters can also help to significantly decrease consumer lag when the rate of incoming messages is too high, thus providing significant performance improvements for your sink.

If your underlying sink is not able to handle increased \(or default\) volume of data being pushed to it, adding some sort of a filter condition in the Firehose to ignore unnecessary messages in the topic would help you bring down the volume of data being processed by the sink.
